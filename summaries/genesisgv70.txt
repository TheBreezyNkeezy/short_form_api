The Electrified G80 will be the first Genesis model assembled in the U.S., specifically at the same Montgomery, Alabama plant that builds the Hyundai Elantra, Santa Cruz, Santa Fe, and Tucson. The Electrified GV70 (a name of which we are not fond, since "electrified" usually implies partial electrification of the powertrain, such as a hybrid, while "electric" means an all-electric car) doesn't ride the dedicated E-GMP platform that underpins the Genesis GV60, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6. Stateside assembly is one criteria the GV70 must meet to qualify for the revised Federal EV tax credit; the others involve the content and assembly of the battery (still an unknown, at least to us) and price, which, for SUVs, must be under $80,000. Slipping in behind the wheel, the view from the driver's seat is largely the same as the gas car but for the color scheme (an optional dark-green-and-white palette already offered on other Genesis electric vehicles) and a "boost" button in the center steering-wheel spoke (which, we imagine, will have the same grin-generating effect as it does in the GV60). Several of our other recent Of the Year winners have been electric, including the Lucid Air sedan, the Rivian R1T pickup and, most recently, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 SUV. The battery itself rides under the floor, as in most dedicated EVs, while the control gear lives under the hood, leaving just enough room for a small cargo box (a frunk in name only). The Genesis Electrified GV70 is scheduled to begin production in the next few weeks, and it shouldn't take much longer than that to get it into dealerships (and, hopefully, the MotorTrend parking lot). That's a good thing for the Electrified GV70, because based on the numbers we're seeing, its EPA range is likely going to be slightly less than that of the smaller, dedicated-EV-GV60â€”240 miles would be our educated guess.
